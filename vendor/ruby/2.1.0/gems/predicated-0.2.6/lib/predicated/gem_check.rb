Predicated is built in a way that allows you to pick and
choose which features to use.

RubyGems has no way to specify optional dependencies,
therefore I've made the decision not to have Predicated
automatically depend into the various gems referenced
in from/to "extensions".

The cost here is that the gem install doesn't necessarily
"just work" for you out of the box.  But in return you get
greater flexibility.

Notably, rails/arel unfortunately has a hard dependency
on Rails 3 activesupport, which requires ruby 1.8.7.
By making from/to dependencies optional, those with
no interest in arel can use Predicated in a wider
variety of environments.
